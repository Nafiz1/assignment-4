        <h1>Who was the best emperor of Rome?</h1>

        <p>
            <i>I believe the best emperor to be Trajan.</i> <br />
            While going through the emperors of Rome, Trajan stood out to me as the best because he
            was honorable, he expanded the Roman Empire, and he cared for the people of Rome.
            Usually when talking about Roman Emperors you will see murder, envy, or arrogance from
            them, but this is not the case with Trajan. Dio Cassius, a statesman of Rome, even
            praises Trajan for his honor and how he neither feared nor hated anyone. He has done a
            lot for Rome, such as expending vast sums for wars and peace, all while not draining
            anyone’s blood. This is a big accomplishment when compared to other emperors and their
            stories of murder.
